While there, I was fortunate enough to involve myself in other initiatives, giving me exposure to a new world of roles within the organization.</p><p id="259b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">After being asked to help out in coordinating some projects I began work with the corporate planning office. The first meeting we had I was introduced to a role new to me, called a <em class="nt">business analyst (BA).</em></p><p id="d16d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Meeting this team of BAs, I felt a real connection to the role, that I could have a career in front of me. There was a real professional practice to what I felt was natural, but was ultimately novel in a policy world. That when working on an initiative we should have a clear vision for why we were doing it, what we hoped to resolve, and what success would look like. Business analysis offered a repeatable methodology for obtaining these answers.</p><p id="800e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">The next initiative I began was towards the development of a standard operating procedures guide to navigate the Agency’s corporate policies and procedures. Throughout this work, there were innumerable “whys” I wanted to ask to bring context to the instructions. I felt drawn to provide background when expecting users to follow instructions. Context, I felt, was key in getting buy-in.</p><p id="63f1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Always questioning the “why” behind a seemingly infinite abyss of process, I was particularly drawn to the process re-engineering elements of the task. I began to look for support from professional disciplines to my incessant probing. My research revealed that again, business analysis would help me apply some method my instincts.</p><p id="7dff" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Learning this, I sought to attain more formal education, leading me to sign up for a program offered jointly by Carleton and York Universities’ business schools. At this program I had the good fortune to learn from some early members in the founding of the International Institute of Business Analysis (IIBA) and some of the world’s first official <em class="nt">Business Analysts.</em></p><p id="7676" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">They shared with the class that the reason they founded the IIBA and created the role was to support a clear value proposition: projects frequently fail and the most frequent cause was poor management of requirements. A role that directly addressed this problem would have a strong return on investment.</p><p id="9951" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">While in the formative years of the role, there were debates on title and responsibilities. Before settling on <em class="nt">Business Analyst</em>, a leading candidate was “Requirements Manager.” Along with the title the role would exist on par with the Project Manager, taking accountability for the scope of an initiative. When incomplete and changing requirements were showing up among the top <a class="ag nu" href="https://www.csus.edu/indiv/r/rengstorffj/obe152-spring02/articles/standishchaos.pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">reasons for project failures,</a> the case was clear: managing requirements would reduce the risk of project failures and save millions in sunk costs.</p><p id="7128" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">This concept of formally managed “requirements” was new to me. They weren’t what had drawn me to the role, nor were they what the business analysts I first met were focused on. The work that the BAs were doing that drew me to the profession was much more focused on identifying the value to the organization and managing to fit it back in as development progressed.</p><h1 id="90e6" class="nv nw ho bf nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">What do I need to be successful?</h1><p id="e3d3" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my ot na nb nc ou ne nf ng ov ni nj nk ow nm nn no ox nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Requirements in the traditional sense simply help define what an initiative needs to achieve to be successful. But there are a few issues with the concept:</p><ul><li id="fe4e" class="mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns oy oz pa bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">They capture the best knowledge available <strong class="mx hp">at a point in time</strong> and rarely change; even worse they often reflect the best understanding of technology by non-technical users without having seen a system or prototype</li><li id="1b72" class="mv mw ho mx b my pb na nb nc pc ne nf ng pd ni nj nk pe nm nn no pf nq nr ns oy oz pa bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">They apply formality to what often would be better served as a conversation or dialogue</li><li id="405c" class="mv mw ho mx b my pb na nb nc pc ne nf ng pd ni nj nk pe nm nn no pf nq nr ns oy oz pa bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">By investing time in documenting them and going through approvals, there is a sunk cost that makes it difficult to change</li><li id="7174" class="mv mw ho mx b my pb na nb nc pc ne nf ng pd ni nj nk pe nm nn no pf nq nr ns oy oz pa bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">There is often resistance to changing them through existing project mechanisms, such as change control, even when new information is uncovered</li></ul><p id="c34d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">These issues are similar to those that hamper the growth of the business analysis practice. The best knowledge available when the role was being created was that the majority of software development was occurring through projects, those projects were failing at an alarming rate (nearly 1/3 being cancelled) and that poor management of requirements was a significant contributor.</p><p id="7701" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">However, today, less than 20% of projects are cancelled and an increasingly large number of projects are being done in an Agile manner (in which only <a class="ag nu" href="https://www.standishgroup.com/sample_research_files/CHAOSReport2015-Final.pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">9% of projects</a> fail). In the most common Agile methodology, Scrum, there is no specific Business Analyst role.

When I began, I was working on one of the last major initiatives managed with strict requirements traceability, focused on stringent use cases and detailed requirements. Artifacts that feel like relics today.</p><p id="dcee" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Throughout the project, I never felt the like the work I did was really adding value to the end users. Instead it felt more akin to writing a dictionary, something that would never be read as a whole but referenced if we encountered a word we didn’t understand. This wasn’t valuable to the people who needed a new system to do their jobs. Sure it was <em class="nt">potentially</em> valuable to investment governance, audit and project management if something went wrong. But choosing to focus on potential value for potential stakeholders over real users was foolhardy.</p><p id="ce3c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">The core focus of my work was to reduce the drift of the project from an objective set at a point with the least information in the project life-cycle.

However, business analysis has a much brighter future if it can address the complexity of systems, organizations, and their use of technology. It can also take the soft skills that have always been core to successfully managing requirements — e.g. consensus building, facilitation and negotiation — to modern development practices.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://atlancia.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://atlancia.com/trade-off-mentality.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Building a Trade-off Mentality</div><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://atlancia.com/media/posts/3/responsive/tradeoffpost-xs.jpg" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="660" width="660"></figure></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__comments"><div class="entry-wrapper"><div class="my-comments-wrapper"><div class="my-comments-inner"><h2 class="custom-h2">Comments</h2><div id="graphcomment"></div><noscript>Please enable JS to use the comments form.</noscript><script type="text/javascript">var __semio__params = {
