<p id="f521" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Carl Sagan’s famous quote inspires deeper thought of how connected our universe is, that to “make an apple pie from scratch” you can keep going one step backwards until one has to “invent the universe.” What struck me was, that somewhere between the start of the universe and baking the pie, we had to draw a line for what we consider “from scratch.” Why would buying pre-made pie crust feel like “cheating,” yet buying pre-ground flour would not? What lines have we drawn without much thought of how we choose them?</p>
<p id="34b1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Let’s imagine a manager asking someone to take on a new task. Consider the assumptions that may be at play: the manager assumes the employee can do the task, will listen, will understand, and could do the work without sacrificing their current efforts. What trade-offs are involved? What work might suffer to focus on this new task? How would the manager or the employee differ in their views of what could be dropped to accommodate the new work and what might those different opinions tell us about what each of them values?</p>
<p id="b657" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">I’ve found it useful to ask myself what assumptions I’m making when I make a statement. This approach helps me identify what trade-offs and assumed truths may need to be evaluated to see if they’re still true. However, within my head, I can take a far more confrontational approach to my thoughts than I may with others. Thus, I worked on trying out a more inquisitive approach using a mental toolkit that I call the “trade-off mentality” as a way to more collaboratively uncover inbuilt assumptions and have open discussions about the underlying rationale behind our decisions, preferences and assumptions.</p>
<p id="60b8" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">While I do believe this is a general toolkit that has helped me think better across multiple domains, the focus in the text below will be largely on software development and teams.</p>
<p id="eef6" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">This mental toolkit is based on four core ideas:</p>
<ul class="">
<li id="f85d" class="vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz wa wb wc bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">First, there ain’t no such thing as a free lunch — we cannot simply get something without giving something up.</li>
<li id="93c7" class="vb vc qk ve b vf wd vh vi vj we vl vm vn wf vp vq vr wg vt vu vv wh vx vy vz wa wb wc bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Second, trade-offs allow us to question what we value.</li>
<li id="3291" class="vb vc qk ve b vf wd vh vi vj we vl vm vn wf vp vq vr wg vt vu vv wh vx vy vz wa wb wc bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Third, trade-offs offer an opportunity for us to discuss ways of splitting or breaking down things we bundle together or associate.</li>
<li id="dabc" class="vb vc qk ve b vf wd vh vi vj we vl vm vn wf vp vq vr wg vt vu vv wh vx vy vz wa wb wc bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Finally, when we evaluate decisions and assumptions, we can gain additional insight by asking ourselves who is being served by balancing and weighing valuations.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="d900" class="wi wj qk bf wk lb wl lc le lf wm lg li in wn io ir ll wo lm lp lq wp lr lu wq bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Idea 1: There ain’t no such thing as a free lunch</h1>
<p id="4c61" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf wr vh vi vj ws vl vm vn wt vp vq vr wu vt vu vv wv vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Central to the first idea is the acknowledgement that all endeavours entail a cost and are bound by constraints. That we cannot get a “free lunch.” Choosing to stay up late to watch another episode of Succession, means accepting you might be a little tired tomorrow. We are constrained by time, energy, money, and many other limits.</p>
<p id="1728" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">For instance, we can look at even subtle constraints to a team’s productivity. My favourite to consider is the cognitive load incurred by increasing work complexity (or simply using the idea of mental energy). Such complexity may hinder growth, or necessitate trade-offs in terms of longer learning, more challenging onboarding, or higher rates of incidents. Surfacing impacts from complexity could help identify future challenges and uncover risks we might not be willing to accept.</p>
<p id="abcd" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Indicator statements such as: “We should make time for training,” “I would like you to deliver this as well,” or “The team must assume accountability for this new system” may serve as potential triggers for conversations on underlying assumptions and required trade-offs. The figure below shows a hypothetical model of transition for a team taking on a new application, in which a new idea comes to mind — the “cost” of assuming new accountabilities.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://atlancia.com/media/posts/3/state-view.webp" alt="" width="2317" height="939" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://atlancia.com/media/posts/3/responsive/state-view-xs.webp 640w ,https://atlancia.com/media/posts/3/responsive/state-view-sm.webp 768w ,https://atlancia.com/media/posts/3/responsive/state-view-md.webp 1024w ,https://atlancia.com/media/posts/3/responsive/state-view-lg.webp 1366w ,https://atlancia.com/media/posts/3/responsive/state-view-xl.webp 1600w ,https://atlancia.com/media/posts/3/responsive/state-view-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure>
<p id="0d62" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">A classic trade-off in systems development, for example, is the balance between investing in new features versus reducing technical debt. A team’s ability to discuss and evaluate these classic trade-offs can have a significant impact on their long-term success. Investments in technical debt reduction, while not as glamorous as new features, can often lead to more sustainable development and increased capacity for future innovation.</p>
<p id="bb5b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">By carefully examining statements, especially those that indicate a “more X” is possible, we can surface implicit assumptions and trade-offs, while individuals and teams can better understand the consequences of their decisions and align their actions with their values and goals.</p>
<h1 id="3055" class="wi wj qk bf wk lb wl lc le lf wm lg li in wn io ir ll wo lm lp lq wp lr lu wq bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Idea 2: Trade-off decisions offer a space to inspect values</h1>
<p id="8949" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf wr vh vi vj ws vl vm vn wt vp vq vr wu vt vu vv wv vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">When confronted with a potential trade-off, we have a space to ask ourselves, “Why did I choose X over Y?” Is that choice consistent with my values? With a team’s values? With an organization’s goals?</p>
<p id="b8ec" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">The act of questioning myself has helped me gain insight into my own beliefs and assumptions. When considering whether to speak up in a group setting, for instance, I consider if I am preventing someone else from contributing or if simply presenting an opinion may discourage dissenting viewpoints. Even the subtle act of supporting an idea may make dissenting viewpoints harder to bring forward.</p>
<p id="eed0" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">When faced with a difficult decision, individuals may engage in a process of introspection, carefully evaluating the relative importance of the available options and the factors that inform those values. This process can be particularly valuable in group settings where individuals with different skill sets and viewpoints must navigate trade-offs to achieve a common goal.</p>
<p id="b429" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">But, evaluating trade-offs is not just an individual activity. Teams and organizations can also benefit from examining the trade-offs they make in pursuit of their goals. By holding up a mirror to themselves and asking if they are truly living up to their values, teams can identify areas for improvement and develop strategies to better align their actions with their goals. For example, a team tasked with reporting weekly on their progress may be trading off valuable development time and energy for the sake of reporting. By examining this trade-off, the team could question which benefits of reporting outweigh the costs and adjust their approach accordingly.</p>
<p id="6ec9" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">This particular idea may be more difficult to have an open dialogue about because it may challenge deeply held assumptions. Two areas I have had difficult discussions about have been the topics of reporting and options analysis. If we believe our value is to deliver work and support clients/customers/users, both would be “wastes” from a Lean perspective. Options analysis embeds a guarantee of waste; that if N+1 options are presented and 1 option is selected the development of N was largely waste. Softer language, of relative value and checking against objectives, helps serve a less aggressive proposition.</p>
<p id="81f3" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Similarly, organizations with a mission to be inclusive may need to examine the trade-offs between objective hiring criteria and the desire to attract a more diverse pool of candidates. Organizations could dig deeper into whether they are truly living up to their values and identify ways to make their processes more equitable and inclusive. Perhaps recognizing that adhering to a strict process may reduce the impact of individual biases while amplifying the impact of structural ones. <em class="vd">e.g. a hiring process that takes 3 months to complete, requires a masters degree and 10 years previous experience excludes the population of people who can’t wait 3 months for a new career and don’t have equitable access to the educational and experience requirements.</em></p>
<p id="b29b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Ultimately, by carefully evaluating the trade-offs we can support, individuals, organizations and teams have more informed decisions and work towards achieving their goals with greater clarity and purpose.</p>
<h1 id="29e5" class="wi wj qk bf wk lb wl lc le lf wm lg li in wn io ir ll wo lm lp lq wp lr lu wq bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Idea 3: Try to unwrap packages</h1>
<p id="ff1e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf wr vh vi vj ws vl vm vn wt vp vq vr wu vt vu vv wv vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">One other technique that has been useful when evaluating trade-offs is to do what I have called unwrapping packages. The idea behind this is to unwrap, unbundle and uncouple to make more honest decisions about trade-offs. In the rest of this section, I’ll focus on particular patterns I have found useful to key in on common “bundlings.”</p>
<p id="382c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">One such pattern is <em class="vd">association</em>. This pattern involves examining implicit connections we make between ideas. For example, we might assume that working in an office is essential for building strong social connections. While there may be some truth to this, it’s important to recognize that there are other ways to foster social connections. By breaking down these associations we can have more a balanced discussion. In the case of working in an office, the trade-off is not simply between having social connections and staying at home. Instead, it’s about the ease of building connections when we are physically together versus the additional effort required to do so when working remotely.</p>
<p id="bdb7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">In this example, we change the discussion from “work from home” vs “connect with new colleagues,” to “work from home and have a more difficult time connecting with new colleagues” vs “go to the office where the friction between meeting new people is lower.” This can support a more nuanced decision, where we can open up dialogue on, for example:</p>
<ul class="">
<li id="1628" class="vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz wa wb wc bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">How to support remote colleagues to form new connections?</li>
<li id="db16" class="vb vc qk ve b vf wd vh vi vj we vl vm vn wf vp vq vr wg vt vu vv wh vx vy vz wa wb wc bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Why does being in the office encourage more connections and if moving around the building is an important factor, how can we offer that same benefit to less mobile colleagues?</li>
</ul>
<p id="453a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">In the world of project management, the concept of a “work package” is all about bundling tasks together into work packages or projects themselves. This approach can be useful in certain situations, particularly when it comes to managing large-scale investments. After all, the bigger the package, the greater the economies of scale that can be achieved (investment governance tends to be roughly equal effort regardless of project sizes).</p>
<p id="fde8" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">However, there are also cases where this approach might be detrimental. In situations where a team is stable, and tools and solutions are already in place, breaking down tasks into smaller packages can be more effective. This allows for greater flexibility in addressing high-priority items, regardless of where they might fit into a larger package.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://atlancia.com/media/posts/3/selected-view.webp" alt="" width="1953" height="902" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://atlancia.com/media/posts/3/responsive/selected-view-xs.webp 640w ,https://atlancia.com/media/posts/3/responsive/selected-view-sm.webp 768w ,https://atlancia.com/media/posts/3/responsive/selected-view-md.webp 1024w ,https://atlancia.com/media/posts/3/responsive/selected-view-lg.webp 1366w ,https://atlancia.com/media/posts/3/responsive/selected-view-xl.webp 1600w ,https://atlancia.com/media/posts/3/responsive/selected-view-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure>
<p id="c94b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">To illustrate this point, let’s consider an abstract example. Imagine that there are three potential packages of work and one of them contains critical work. There’s no question that this work should take priority over all other work. However, if this critical work is bundled with other non-critical work, the entire package might be completed before other packages containing high-priority work. In this scenario, the lower-priority work ends up taking precedence simply because it was packaged together with the critical work. By breaking work down into smaller, more manageable pieces, teams can avoid this issue and ensure that the most important work always takes priority.</p>
<p id="7b72" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">While on the subject of processes, another common pattern is historical linkage; rules and procedures that persist even if they are no longer relevant or useful. For example, some project methodologies require consultation with a vendor or asset management team as a precaution against licensing overages and legal risks. While this may have made sense in the past, with the rise of cloud technology, the need for such consultations is much lower (with software included in the service offering). However, because of the long-standing association between vendor management and licensing, this may be embedded as a required step for going live with delivery even though the previous risk has subsided.</p>
<h1 id="cdb9" class="wi wj qk bf wk lb wl lc le lf wm lg li in wn io ir ll wo lm lp lq wp lr lu wq bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Idea 4: Who is being served?</h1>
<p id="1821" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf wr vh vi vj ws vl vm vn wt vp vq vr wu vt vu vv wv vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Finally, and usually done in concert with the above ideas, is to look at “who is being served” by a choice.</p>
<p id="8c5b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">I recall years ago during the transition from an older platform for document management to a newer one, I was part of a group to decide what the folder structure ought to be for projects and support teams. The facilitator in the discussion walked in with the assumption that we needed to have the same structure for everyone. This assumption certainly made sense for their project, once defined it could be copied and pasted for everyone and they could move on. However, in representing teams’ needs the group had very different ideas of what worked best for them.</p>
<p id="0ffe" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Seeing an opportunity to ask, I posed a question to the group on where this assumption was made. The conversation went a little something like this:</p>
<p id="45b7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em class="vd">Facilitator: </em>“We need to standardize folder structure so that when a team member joins from another project they can find documents.”</p>
<p id="831d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em class="vd">Me: </em>“How often does it happen?”</p>
<p id="7173" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em class="vd">Facilitator: </em>“Maybe a couple of times a year”</p>
<p id="9d3a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em class="vd">Me:</em> “Are we sure that designing a standard system to serve a twice-a-year event, over allowing the unique needs of teams and projects to be served is the best approach? When I’ve seen new team members join there’s usually been additional guidance provided, a “buddy system” usually, to help them orient themselves on what’s important. Wouldn’t that help serve that need?”</p>
<p id="9022" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Others seemed to react positively to the idea and the discussion following was more positive. There is no current standard, but there is a “starting” template to get teams off on the right foot. We struck a better balance.</p>
<p id="2bb8" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Another example was offered above, requests that may come for status reporting. It’s certainly understandable for leaders to want visibility into work. Yet, accepting that reporting doesn’t come for free and that when data on team performance “escapes” the team it costs the team safety to make changes — especially when an experiment might cause a temporary slowdown. Is it worth serving a leader’s need for observability over the potential drawbacks of lower team safety and less available time for work? Perhaps, but raising the discussion and balancing leadership’s need to work with their peers, stakeholders and other leaders allows for more nuance, especially for metrics that may influence team behaviours.</p>
<p id="4591" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">The classic adage of <a class="ag xd" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Goodheart’s Law</a>: would state that “when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” An unfortunate example of this has occurred in hospitals in the UK where a focus on individual mortality rates for surgeons alters their behaviour with <a class="ag xd" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/06/03/one-in-three-heart-surgeons-refuse-difficult-operations-to-avoid/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">1 in 3 surgeons reported avoiding difficult cases to protect their metrics</a>. The trade-off we make when metrics escape, doesn’t mean we ought to avoid reporting, but that we should discuss what effects might come from them.</p>
<p id="75ec" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">For those in software, there are well-established metrics available, colloquially called the<a class="ag xd" href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"> DORA metrics</a>, with years of research behind them. These metrics are described by Google as:</p>
<p id="d3b4" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em class="vd">Deployment Frequency — How often an organization successfully releases to production</em></p>
<p id="f113" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em class="vd">Lead Time for Changes — The amount of time it takes a commit to get into production</em></p>
<p id="2ede" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em class="vd">Change Failure Rate — The percentage of deployments causing a failure in production</em></p>

<h1 id="f447" class="wi wj qk bf wk lb wl lc le lf wm lg li in wn io ir ll wo lm lp lq wp lr lu wq bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Wrap-Up</h1>
<p id="85ad" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf wr vh vi vj ws vl vm vn wt vp vq vr wu vt vu vv wv vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">In environments where we are constantly making decisions, it’s easy to overlook the assumptions and trade-offs we make. The idea of a free lunch is a myth; everything we do comes at a cost. A trade-off mentality, informed by the four ideas above, has helped me have better conversations with others and better introspection. By acknowledging the constraints that underlie our systems, I feel better equipped to have constructive, open conversations.</p>
<p id="0f07" class="pw-post-body-paragraph vb vc qk ve b vf vg vh vi vj vk vl vm vn vo vp vq vr vs vt vu vv vw vx vy vz ga bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">While it’s been helpful for now to adopt a more inquisitive “trade-off mentality,” it’s still a work in progress. Through this lens, I work to support better dialogue. If you’re reading this, try it out the next time you are confronted with a difficult decision or hear a statement that “doesn’t sit right.” Remember to acknowledge that nothing comes for free and when we work in complex environments, we work best when we openly discuss our ideas and concerns. When you are brought into these discussions, challenge yourself to question “What’s the trade-off here?”</p>

<p id="7b5b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">My first exposure to the business analyst role was at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), while working with a team focused on policy. While there, I was fortunate enough to involve myself in other initiatives, giving me exposure to a new world of roles within the organization.</p>
<p id="259b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">After being asked to help out in coordinating some projects I began work with the corporate planning office. The first meeting we had I was introduced to a role new to me, called a <em class="nt">business analyst (BA).</em></p>
<p id="d16d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Meeting this team of BAs, I felt a real connection to the role, that I could have a career in front of me. There was a real professional practice to what I felt was natural, but was ultimately novel in a policy world. That when working on an initiative we should have a clear vision for why we were doing it, what we hoped to resolve, and what success would look like. Business analysis offered a repeatable methodology for obtaining these answers.</p>
<p id="800e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">The next initiative I began was towards the development of a standard operating procedures guide to navigate the Agency’s corporate policies and procedures. Throughout this work, there were innumerable “whys” I wanted to ask to bring context to the instructions. I felt drawn to provide background when expecting users to follow instructions. Context, I felt, was key in getting buy-in.</p>
<p id="63f1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Always questioning the “why” behind a seemingly infinite abyss of process, I was particularly drawn to the process re-engineering elements of the task. I began to look for support from professional disciplines to my incessant probing. My research revealed that again, business analysis would help me apply some method my instincts.</p>
<p id="7dff" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Learning this, I sought to attain more formal education, leading me to sign up for a program offered jointly by Carleton and York Universities’ business schools. At this program I had the good fortune to learn from some early members in the founding of the International Institute of Business Analysis (IIBA) and some of the world’s first official <em class="nt">Business Analysts.</em></p>
<p id="7676" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">They shared with the class that the reason they founded the IIBA and created the role was to support a clear value proposition: projects frequently fail and the most frequent cause was poor management of requirements. A role that directly addressed this problem would have a strong return on investment.</p>
<p id="9951" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">While in the formative years of the role, there were debates on title and responsibilities. Before settling on <em class="nt">Business Analyst</em>, a leading candidate was “Requirements Manager.” Along with the title the role would exist on par with the Project Manager, taking accountability for the scope of an initiative. When incomplete and changing requirements were showing up among the top <a class="ag nu" href="https://www.csus.edu/indiv/r/rengstorffj/obe152-spring02/articles/standishchaos.pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">reasons for project failures,</a> the case was clear: managing requirements would reduce the risk of project failures and save millions in sunk costs.</p>
<p id="7128" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">This concept of formally managed “requirements” was new to me. They weren’t what had drawn me to the role, nor were they what the business analysts I first met were focused on. The work that the BAs were doing that drew me to the profession was much more focused on identifying the value to the organization and managing to fit it back in as development progressed.</p>
<h1 id="90e6" class="nv nw ho bf nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">What do I need to be successful?</h1>
<p id="e3d3" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my ot na nb nc ou ne nf ng ov ni nj nk ow nm nn no ox nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Requirements in the traditional sense simply help define what an initiative needs to achieve to be successful. But there are a few issues with the concept:</p>
<ul class="">
<li id="fe4e" class="mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns oy oz pa bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">They capture the best knowledge available <strong class="mx hp">at a point in time</strong> and rarely change; even worse they often reflect the best understanding of technology by non-technical users without having seen a system or prototype</li>
<li id="1b72" class="mv mw ho mx b my pb na nb nc pc ne nf ng pd ni nj nk pe nm nn no pf nq nr ns oy oz pa bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">They apply formality to what often would be better served as a conversation or dialogue</li>
<li id="405c" class="mv mw ho mx b my pb na nb nc pc ne nf ng pd ni nj nk pe nm nn no pf nq nr ns oy oz pa bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">By investing time in documenting them and going through approvals, there is a sunk cost that makes it difficult to change</li>
<li id="7174" class="mv mw ho mx b my pb na nb nc pc ne nf ng pd ni nj nk pe nm nn no pf nq nr ns oy oz pa bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">There is often resistance to changing them through existing project mechanisms, such as change control, even when new information is uncovered</li>
</ul>
<p id="c34d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">These issues are similar to those that hamper the growth of the business analysis practice. The best knowledge available when the role was being created was that the majority of software development was occurring through projects, those projects were failing at an alarming rate (nearly 1/3 being cancelled) and that poor management of requirements was a significant contributor.</p>
<p id="7701" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">However, today, less than 20% of projects are cancelled and an increasingly large number of projects are being done in an Agile manner (in which only <a class="ag nu" href="https://www.standishgroup.com/sample_research_files/CHAOSReport2015-Final.pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">9% of projects</a> fail). In the most common Agile methodology, Scrum, there is no specific Business Analyst role. The wild west of projects looks to be maturing, finding new ways to be successful without the tools of projects past.</p>
<p id="f9de" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">What this tells us is a story of a core skill-set that is languishing, yet the role is growing:</p>

<p id="8215" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my ot na nb nc ou ne nf ng ov ni nj nk ow nm nn no ox nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">The role of the business analyst has become increasingly common in organizations and looking to grow (in the US an <a class="ag nu" href="https://www.floridatechonline.com/blog/business/business-analyst-career-and-salary-profile/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">expected 14% growth</a> from 2014 to 2024). What are they doing if they aren’t focused on what we used to call “business analysis?”</p>
<p id="c0b0" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">From personal experience, I have seen a shift from when I started working as a Business Analyst in 2011. When I began, I was working on one of the last major initiatives managed with strict requirements traceability, focused on stringent use cases and detailed requirements. Artifacts that feel like relics today.</p>
<p id="dcee" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Throughout the project, I never felt the like the work I did was really adding value to the end users. Instead it felt more akin to writing a dictionary, something that would never be read as a whole but referenced if we encountered a word we didn’t understand. This wasn’t valuable to the people who needed a new system to do their jobs. Sure it was <em class="nt">potentially</em> valuable to investment governance, audit and project management if something went wrong. But choosing to focus on potential value for potential stakeholders over real users was foolhardy.</p>
<p id="ce3c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">The core focus of my work was to reduce the drift of the project from an objective set at a point with the least information in the project life-cycle. Even worse, to produce work that would make course correction more costly.</p>
<p id="ba9b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">What felt the most valuable was not the work I was supposed to be focused on. Instead, I found that the most rewarding work fit into two areas; ensuring that the project “fit” into the organization and leveraging soft skills like facilitation and consensus building to connect the many parties involved and help them understand the complexities behind decisions.</p>

I distinctly remember looking at project with 500+ discrete requirements and thinking to myself; “how can anybody possibly be sure these are still true?” The “modern” Business Analyst has value, and is most valuable when they are contributing their skill-set to work that helps the organization navigate itself through the endless sea of change on the horizon.</p>
<p id="1480" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">The role of Business Analyst has a lot to contribute, but it’s most valuable when we can balance the interests of a project with the interests of the organization. In finding that balance, the role of Business Analyst returns to a clear value proposition. To do what the role has historically done well at, provide the organization an interface to support changes inside and out.</p>
<p id="5e95" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mv mw ho mx b my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Business analysis as a practice dedicated to managing requirements is on its way out. However, business analysis has a much brighter future if it can address the complexity of systems, organizations, and their use of technology. It can also take the soft skills that have always been core to successfully managing requirements — e.g. consensus building, facilitation and negotiation — to modern development practices.</p>
