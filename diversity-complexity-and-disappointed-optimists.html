Best practices become good practices, the very notion that a single practice can be best is a fools errand. Processes become anchors slowing down needed change. Staying still becomes as big a risk as changing, where adaptability is a dimension of organizational resilience (see BS 65000:2022 — Organizational Resilience).</p><blockquote class="mg mh mi"><p id="40ec" class="mj mk ml mm b mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em class="ha">All models are wrong, some are useful. — George Box, 1976</em></p></blockquote><p id="609f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk ha mm b mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Amidst the ever-evolving landscape of modern work dynamics the model at hand may indeed falter in numerous aspects, no model will ever be perfect. However, at the heart of this idea lies a pivotal concept: a tipping point where the realm of work is no longer defined by the comfort of predictability, but by the challenges of unpredictability. A paradigm shift that encourages us to re-calibrate our approach.

There is no clear line between the two ideas in real life, with problems don’t come with a label. Some problems have puzzled mathematicians for years with no solution that seem easy but have no solution: the moving sofa problem (What is the largest area of a shape that can be maneuvered through a unit-width L-shaped corridor?) as an example, has no solution.</p><p id="6037" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk ha mm b mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">In Nassim Nicolas Taleb’s <em class="ml">Antifragile</em> he offers some indicators that a system is complex. That complex systems are characterized by intricate interdependencies and nonlinear responses. In these systems, doubling a factor does not result in a proportional doubling of the effect but rather an amplified or diminished impact. Simple cause-and-effect relationships do not hold, and understanding the functioning of individual parts alone is insufficient.</p><p id="0c1f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk ha mm b mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">And so, we go full circle. The opening quote of this writing from the <em class="ml">Mythical Man-Month</em>, exemplifies this non-linearity. The conclusion that adding more developers to a late project tends to make them later, is a great indicator that software development, and likely all similarly intangible knowledge work, is complex, not simple or complicated.

I’d argue that we simply can’t. The volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity of the work environment ought to compel teams to add skills different from their own as a route to making themselves and their teams better. Holding onto notions of strict “qualifications” serve to limit the pool of perspectives and tools that teams may have access to. Certainly, there’s a need to retain germane skills but when work requires increasing breadth of knowledge can we reasonably expect to address new challenges by bringing in people who look, act and work just like us?</p></div></div></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://atlancia.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://atlancia.com/building-a-trade-off-mentality.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://atlancia.com/media/posts/3/responsive/tradeoffpost-xs.jpg" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="660" width="660"></figure><div><span>Previous</span> Building a Trade-off Mentality</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://atlancia.com/leading-from-the-middle-how-direct-leaders-can-shape-innovation-culture.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Leading from the Middle - How Direct Leaders can Shape Innovation Culture</div><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://atlancia.com/media/posts/5/responsive/middle-header-xs.webp" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="500" width="500"></figure></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__comments"><div class="entry-wrapper"><div class="my-comments-wrapper"><div class="my-comments-inner"><h2 class="custom-h2">Comments</h2><div id="graphcomment"></div><noscript>Please enable JS to use the comments form.</noscript><script type="text/javascript">var __semio__params = {
